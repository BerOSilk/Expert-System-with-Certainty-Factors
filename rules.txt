# Rule Definition Guidelines
# Each rule must follow the format: {evidence} THEN {hypothesis} \cf {cf value}
# If a rule contains multiple pieces of evidence, they must be connected using only the logical operators AND or OR. Do not use any other connectors.
# Both the evidence and the hypothesis should be written in the format: {subject} is {state} (e.g., {today} is {rain}). The content within the curly braces {} is variable and should be customized accordingly.
# Any line that begins with # or is left blank will be ignored during processing.
